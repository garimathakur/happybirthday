<h1>HOW TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE</h1>	
<p>Having a normal life may sound like a simple goal, but it's actually a complex concept. What's normal for one person may not be normal for another, especially in a different culture or society. At the same time, the idea of normalcy is constantly changing. To have a normal life, you'll need to decide what is normal for you. While some individuals enjoy their uniqueness and individuality, other people need routines and structure.[1] Discover what you consider to be normal and create daily routines that work for you.</p>
